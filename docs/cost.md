# Cost Plan (Azure $150/month)

## Budget target
- Hard cap: $150/month

## Current plan (subject to sponsor guidance)
- Dev: local execution for parsing (dumpbin) when possible
- Cloud: minimal compute for verification UI + MCP server
- Prefer serverless / on-demand compute to avoid idle costs

## Cost controls
- Use free tiers where possible
- Turn off resources when not testing
- Track spend weekly (screenshot or Azure Cost Management export)
