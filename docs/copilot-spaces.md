# Copilot Spaces Context Guide

**Purpose:** This document tells Copilot (and team members) how to read and understand the mcp-factory documentation ecosystem.

**Use this before committing:** Reference this guide to ensure your documentation updates are consistent and complete.

---

## Documentation Ecosystem

### 1. **copilot-log/entries.md** — Daily Work Log
**Purpose:** Record every Copilot interaction, what was built, what changed.  
**Cadence:** After each work session with Copilot  
**Audience:** Archival record, basis for lab-notes later

**REQUIRED Format (exact structure):**
```markdown
## [DATE] — [Feature/Task Name]

**Task/Issue:** [What problem were we solving?]

**Copilot Prompts Used:**
- "Prompt 1 that generated expected output"
- "Prompt 2 that generated expected output"
- "Prompt 3 that generated expected output"

**Output Accepted:**
- List of files/code Copilot generated
- What worked from the response
- What you accepted as-is

**Manual Changes:**
- List of edits you made after Copilot generated code
- Bug fixes, adjustments, refinements
- Why each change was needed

**Result:**
- Command(s) to reproduce
- Expected outputs (file names, sizes, sample data)
- Test results/metrics

**Notes:**
- Important implementation details
- Edge cases handled
- Known limitations

**References:**
- Related ADRs, commits, docs
- External documentation links
```

**Why this format:**
- **Prompts Used** (not just "Prompt"):  Show the exact prompts that yielded the result. Future you/teammates can re-run these.
- **Output Accepted + Manual Changes**: Separate the Copilot work from your work. Clear accountability.
- **Result + Notes**: Make reproducibility explicit. Show the happy path and caveats.

**Recent Entries:**
- 2026-01-19: Fixture Harness + Robust Parser
- 2026-01-20: 8-Module Refactoring + CLI Orchestration
- 2026-01-20: Production Polish + Developer Experience
- 2026-01-21: Confidence Scoring + Frictionless Setup (12 commits)

### 2. **lab-notes.md** — Implementation Narrative
**Purpose:** Weekly summary of what was built, how it works, why decisions were made.  
**Cadence:** Weekly (or after major feature completion)

[Links to related code, commits, docs]
```

**Current ADRs:**

### 4. **sections-2-3.md** — Section Status & Scope
**Purpose:** Live document showing what's complete, in-progress, limitations for this section.  
**Cadence:** Updated when scope changes or major milestones reached  
**Audience:** Team, project sponsors

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Sections 2–3: [Section Name]

## What's Complete ✅
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]

## In Progress 🚀
- [Feature 3]

## What's Not Supported Yet ❌

|--------|-------|
| Header match | 98.4% |
| Confidence HIGH | 8 exports |

## Known Limitations
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

## Next Iteration Scope
- [What's next]
```

**Current Status (2026-01-21):**
- Status: ✅ Complete
- 187 zstd exports analyzed (98.4% header match)
- 294 sqlite3 exports analyzed (95.9% header match)
- Confidence scoring: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW tiers
- Frictionless one-command setup: verified on 2+ machines

---

### 5. **meeting-notes/** — Team & Sponsor Meetings
**Purpose:** Record decisions, guidance, action items from meetings.  
**Cadence:** After each meeting with team or sponsors  
**Audience:** Team alignment, decision audit trail

**Structure:**
```markdown
# Meeting: [Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Attendees:** [Names]

## Discussion
- [Key topic 1]
- [Key topic 2]

## Decisions Made

## Commit Message Conventions

**For Copilot-assisted work:**
```
feat: [description]
  - What was built
  - Why it matters
  - Related ADR/issue (if applicable)
```

**Recent Examples:**
```
feat: add confidence scoring with color-coded output
  - Implements 6-factor confidence analysis
  - Enables Section 4 to prioritize exports
  - Related: ADR-0003

fix: guard repo-local vcpkg check against empty RepoRoot
  - Prevents "empty string" error on fresh machines
  - Tested on 2+ clean Windows installations
```

## How Copilot Spaces Uses This

When you create a Space with this repo, Copilot will:

1. **Index all docs** (automatic)
   - Reads entries.md, lab-notes.md, ADRs, sections-2-3.md
   - Builds knowledge graph of decisions + implementations

2. **Use as context** when you ask questions
   - "What is confidence scoring?" → reads ADR-0003 + lab-notes
   - "How does the discovery pipeline work?" → reads sections-2-3.md + architecture.md

3. **Understand team roles**
   - Evan: Sections 2-3 (discovery, confidence)
   - Layalie & Caden: Section 4 (MCP generation)
   - Thinh: Section 5 (verification UI)

4. **Remember decisions**
   - ADRs persist across conversations
   - Lab-notes provide implementation history
   - Entries.md shows exact prompts that worked

## Example: Using This Guide Before a Commit

**Scenario:** You just built .NET reflection discovery for Section 3.

**Before committing:**

1. Read this guide → Understand what goes where
2. Add to `entries.md` → Record Copilot prompts used
3. Add to `lab-notes.md` → Implementation summary
4. Create `adr/0004-dotnet-reflection.md` → Design decision
5. Create `docs/sections-3.md` → Section status
6. Verify this guide is still accurate
7. Commit all docs + code together
8. Push to GitHub

**Result:** Copilot Spaces immediately understands:
- What you built (entries.md)
- Why you built it that way (ADR-0004)
- How it works (lab-notes.md)
- What's complete (sections-3.md)

Team can jump in immediately without questions. ✅
